# New Feature Implementation Workflow

When you are asked to implement a new feature, you must follow this eight-step process:

1.  **Check Documentation First:** Review all relevant project documentation in `<prj root>/docs/` and all previous implementation logs in `<prj root>/docs/impl/`. This is critical for understanding context, requirements, and past decisions.

2.  **Check Code:** Analyze the existing codebase to understand the current architecture, identify affected areas, and ensure the new feature integrates smoothly.

3.  **Make a Plan:** Based on the findings from the documentation and code, create a detailed implementation plan.

4.  **Write a Plan Document:** Formalize the plan into a clear and concise document and save it inside the `<prj root>/docs/plan/` directory.

5.  **User Approval of Plan:** Present the plan document to the user for approval. You **must not** proceed with implementation until the user explicitly approves the plan.

6.  **Implement the Plan:** Once the user approves the plan, execute the implementation according to the steps outlined in the document.

7.  **Log the Implementation:** After implementation is complete, create a new document in the `<prj root>/docs/impl/` directory that logs the changes made.

8.  **Test the Implementation:** Thoroughly test the new feature to ensure it functions correctly and does not introduce any regressions or bugs.
