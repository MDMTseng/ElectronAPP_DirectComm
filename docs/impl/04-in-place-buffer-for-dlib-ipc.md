## 1. Summary

This document outlines the implementation of an in-place buffer modification strategy for inter-process communication (IPC) between the Electron renderer process and a C++ dynamic library. This change was made to resolve a critical error ("External buffers are not allowed") encountered with modern Electron versions while still achieving high-performance, zero-copy data exchange.

The final approach involves the renderer allocating a buffer and passing it to the native C++ layer, where the dynamic library writes data directly into it. This avoids memory allocation in the native code and is compatible with Electron's security model.

## 2. The Problem: "External buffers are not allowed"

The initial goal was to optimize the communication between the JavaScript renderer and the C++ dynamic library by minimizing data copies. The first attempt involved modifying the N-API addon to wrap the memory allocated by the C++ dynamic library into a `Napi::Buffer` and return it to JavaScript, with a finalizer to release the memory later.

While this is a standard zero-copy technique in Node.js, it produced the following error in the Electron environment:

```
Error: External buffers are not allowed
```

## 3. Investigation: Electron's V8 Memory Cage

Research and user-provided context revealed that this error is not a simple bug but an intentional security feature in Electron (version 20 and newer). This feature, known as the "V8 Memory Cage," isolates the memory space that the V8 JavaScript engine can access.

The error occurred because our C++ dynamic library was allocating memory *outside* this V8 memory cage. When our addon tried to wrap this external memory in a `Buffer` and pass it to the renderer, Electron's security model correctly blocked it. This is a known breaking change that affects many native modules, as discussed in the Electron GitHub issue **[#35801](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/35801)**.

Reverting to the original method of copying the data into a new buffer (`Napi::Buffer::Copy`) resolved the error, but at the cost of performance.

## 4. The Solution: In-Place Modification

To achieve the goal of a high-performance, zero-copy data exchange while respecting Electron's security constraints, a new strategy was adopted:

1.  **Buffer Allocation in Renderer:** The renderer process, which operates within the V8 memory cage, allocates a `Buffer` of a sufficient size.
2.  **Pass Buffer to Native Layer:** This buffer is passed as an argument to our native addon function.
3.  **Modify in C++:** The addon passes the buffer's raw pointer down to the C++ dynamic library. The library then writes its data directly into this pre-allocated memory block.
4.  **Return Bytes Written:** The native function returns the number of bytes that were written into the buffer.
5.  **Read in Renderer:** The renderer can now read the data from the original buffer, slicing it to the length of the actual data written.

This approach is both secure and efficient, as the memory is always owned and managed by V8, and no data is copied between the native and JS layers.

## 5. Code Changes

### `ext_native/dlib.cpp`

-   A new function, `exchange_inplace`, was added. It accepts a raw pointer and a size, writes a string directly into the provided memory, and returns the number of bytes written.

### `src/native/addon.cpp`

-   A new N-API function, `ExchangeDataInPlace`, was created and exported to JavaScript.
-   This function receives a `Buffer` from JavaScript, gets its underlying pointer and size, and passes them to `exchange_inplace` in the dynamic library.
-   It returns the result of `exchange_inplace` (the bytes written) back to the renderer as a `Napi::Number`.

### `src/renderer.js`

-   The event listener for the "Exchange Data" button was updated.
-   It now uses `Buffer.alloc()` to create a buffer.
-   It calls the new `addon.exchangeDataInPlace()` function, passing the buffer.
-   It uses the returned `bytesWritten` count to `slice()` the buffer and display the string result.
